# Nmap.sh
This is a simple script to automate nmap scans.

The usage is quite simple, just append the address you want to scan after the script and it's done.

Example: nmap.sh <TARGET_IP>.

This script is gonna execute 2 scans, the first one on the most common ports, the second one on the full range of them.

Both scans are gonna have separate output.
